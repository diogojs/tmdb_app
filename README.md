# The Movie Database App
A little app to see upcoming movies.
Data get from [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.

### Code Challenge Report
- All tasks were completed, except optional task "Implement search".
- To improve user experience, besides current in memory cache, a local storage (SQLite db) could be implemented to save and retrieve data from previous requests.
With current architecture (especially MoviesDataSource interface) it's easy to implement.
